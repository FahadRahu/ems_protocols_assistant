<h2>2/8/2025</h2>
<p>After working on this project for a while, 
I want to change how I worked and planned to 
keep working on my procedures/ and protocols/ 
directories</p>
<p>Right now, I have defined functions for multiple 
protocols and procedures, but I want to take a 
class-based approach rather than a function based 
approach. I think this might be better for the long 
run, but the only problem is that I'm basically 
fundamentally changing how I went about doing this 
project.</p>
<p>I added test_new_ideas.py to test and implement 
classes in a small scale and go from there. Learning 
all of this is one thing, putting it in practice is 
another, I'll probably keep this document as a log 
to track some progress along the way, but there'll 
also be progression notes in each one of my git 
commits.</p>
